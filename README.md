The **Mariana Trench** is an *oceanic trench* located in the western [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean). It is the deepest oceanic trench on the planet, and also harbours [Challenger Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_Deep), the *deepest point on Earth*.

## Etymology
The name comes from the nearby *Mariana Islands*, which are named in honour of Spanish Queen [Mariana of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_of_Austria).

## Geology
The Mariana Trench is the subduction zone between the *Pacific* and *Mariana* tectonic plates. Geological material at the western portion of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on Earth.

## Life
Expeditions ranging from 1960 to present day have documented a variety of different marine species, such as *flatfish*, *shrimp*, *snailfish*, and incredibly large [amphipods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipoda).

### Pollution
On a 2016 expedition to the trench, rsearchers found extremely high concentrations of [PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl). Microplastics were also found present in **100%** of the documented amphipods.
